Notes by WLA:  

Today's experiment is about finding blocks of lines in between some
special syntax HTML tag lines. One aim is to explore ways to handle
inline HTML in markdown files. This may be too hard, or require a lot
of hand coding of special cases to be of general use. Nonetheless, we
are persisting in experimenting.

The programming idea is to handle the lines in between the special raw
html-like tags by extending `mistletoe` parsing and rendering of
markdown. The content below is information that may help write a
workable `mistletoe` extension.  


Here is the content of a Python REPL:  
```python
>>> text2='''
... Some text before
... {< div class="example" id="test" >}
... Line 1 inside the div
... Line 2 inside the div
... Line 3 inside the div
... {< /div >}
... Some text after
... {< div another="example" >}
... Another div content
... More content
... {< /div >}
... '''
>>> 
>>> text2
'\nSome text before\n{< div class="example" id="test" >}\nLine 1 inside the div\nLine 2 inside the div\nLine 3 inside the div\n{< /div >}\nSome text after\n{< div another="example" >}\nAnother div content\nMore content\n{< /div >}\n'

>>> pattern2 = r'(?s)\{< div ([^<]*) >\}\n(.*?)\n\{< /div >\}'

>>> re.findall(pattern2,text2)
[('class="example" id="test"', 'Line 1 inside the div\nLine 2 inside the div\nLine 3 inside the div'), ('another="example"', 'Another div content\nMore content')]
```

First test program is named `nxchtml1.py`  
 - the span_token pattern does not work for the group of lines (sort
   of knew that ...)
