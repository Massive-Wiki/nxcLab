# 2024-09-23 notes

1. initial integration of RawHTML processing into
   `MassiveWikiRenderer` seems to work as expected.
   
2. discovered that incipient link CSS needs to be incorporated into
   `dolce`
   
3. next steps include:
 - seeing how well curlybrace tags can be used with CSS
 - reviewing how to describe use of curlybrace tags  
 
 - incorporating curlybrace tag processing into first release of
   `nxc`?
