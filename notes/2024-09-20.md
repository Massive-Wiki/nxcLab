1. many experiments and mistletoe code reading sessions later:  
 - `rawhtml.py` matches the curlybrace html tag patterns
 - replace curly-brace/angle-bracket with plain angle-bracket works
 
2. some TODOs:  
 - DONE handle multiple lines between curlybrace-tags  
 - incorporate `rawhtml` processing into `MassiveWikiRenderer`
   (seems straightforward: can modify installed `nxc` code in a `venv`)

## 2024-09-21 notes
1. experimenting with rendering lines between the curlybrace tags.
 - this line recursively calls render with the between lines:  
  `between_tags = self.render(Document(''.join(token.target[1:-1])))`
  
 - observations:
   - works well for `{< div` sections; i.e., the inner sections are
     appropriately rendered as markdown.
   - does not work, e.g., for `{< p` markup; the text in between the
     curlybrace start and end tags is rendered as its own paragraph,
     so any styling or other properties in the outer `p` tag are lost.
	 
  - so maybe the use practice rule is to use `div` ids or classes to
    add specific properties to common tags.
  - the difficulties that arise illustrate that mixing Markdown and
    HTML does not admit of a simple general case solution.
