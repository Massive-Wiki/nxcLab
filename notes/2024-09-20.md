1. many experiments and mistletoe code reading sessions later:  
 - `rawhtml.py` matches the curlybrace html tag patterns
 - replace curly-brace/angle-bracket with plain angle-bracket works
 
2. some TODOs:  
 - handle multiple lines between curlybrace-tags  
 - incorporate `rawhtml` processing into `MassiveWikiRenderer`
   (seems straightforward: can modify installed `nxc` code in a `venv`)
